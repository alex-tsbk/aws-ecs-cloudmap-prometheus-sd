# AWS CloudMap Ecs Prometheus Discovery

**THIS APPLICATION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Overview
`Apptality.CloudMapEcsPrometheusDiscovery` is a C# project designed to facilitate service discovery within AWS CloudMap for ECS services,
specifically tailored for Prometheus service discovery.
This solution leverages AWS CloudMap and ECS to dynamically discover services and their instances,
making it easier for Prometheus to monitor these services without hardcoding their addresses or ports.

## Features
- **AWS CloudMap Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS CloudMap to discover services.
- **ECS Service Discovery**: Supports discovery of ECS services, enabling dynamic monitoring.
- **Prometheus Compatibility**: Designed with Prometheus in mind, ensuring compatibility for service monitoring.
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Built to be scalable and flexible, adapting to changes in the service infrastructure.

## Getting Started
TBD

## Architecture
This project is structured into several components focusing on different aspects of service discovery:

- **Discovery**: Core project logic for discovering services and instances.
- **Components**: Modular components for CloudMap and ECS discovery.
- **Options**: Configuration options for controlling discovery behavior.
