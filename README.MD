ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§ This repo is still work in progress and is subject to change.

## Overview

This application facilitates discovery of ECS and/or CloudMap resources,
specifically tailored to be compatible with [Prometheus HTTP Service Discovery](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/#writing-http-service-discovery).

This solution leverages AWS API to dynamically discover:

* [ECS Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html), related ECS Services, and ECS Tasks
* [CloudMap Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-namespaces.html), registered Service Connect and Service Discovery services, and their instances

making it easier for Prometheus to monitor these services without hardcoding their addresses or ports, or using any kind of file-based service discovery.

## Features

Below is a high level overview of what application is capable of. For the full list of supported configuration parameters and how to override these using [Docker Environment Variables](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#env) please refer to [appsettings.json](src/Apptality.CloudMapEcsPrometheusDiscovery/appsettings.json)

* **Prometheus Compatibility**: By default, exposes `9001:/prometheus-targets` endpoint which response is compatible with [<http_sd_config>](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/#writing-http-service-discovery) of Prometheus configuration file, as well as with [OpenTelemetry Prometheus Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver/README.md) (see example below).

* **ECS Discovery**: Supports discovery of ECS clusters, services, running tasks
  * Supply `EcsClusters` as semicolon separated string of ECS clusters to include: `"cluster1;cluster2;"`
  * Supports filtering of ECS Services that should be included in the Prometheus response based on Resource Tags (see `EcsServiceSelectorTags` configuration property)
  * Supports filtering to control which tags should be included as labels in the response (see `EcsTaskTags`, `EcsServiceTags` configuration properties)
* **AWS CloudMap Integration**: Supports discovery of CloudMap namespaces, services and instances
  * Supply `CloudMapNamespaces` as semicolon separated string of CloudMap namespaces to include: `"namespace1;"`
  * Supports filtering of CloudMap Services that should be included in the Prometheus response based on Resource Tags (see `CloudMapServiceSelectorTags` configuration property)
  * Supports filtering to control which tags should be included as labels in the response (see `CloudMapServiceTags`, `CloudMapNamespaceTags` configuration properties)
* **Scalable and Flexible**: Built to be scalable and flexible, adapting to changes in the service infrastructure
  * Allows having any number of port-metrics pairs per each running ECS Task (useful when your ECS Task Definition defines multiple containers, which also expose ports and metrics endpoint). See `MetricsPathPortTagPrefix` configuration property for more details.
  * Allows supplying static set of labels to be added to every Prometheus target (see `ExtraPrometheusLabels` configuration property)
  * Supports rich mechanism for re-labling, so you don't have to fix your Grafana dashboards. See `RelabelConfigurations` configuration property for more details.
  * Exposes health check endpoint: `/health`

At least one of `EcsClusters` or `CloudMapNamespaces` must be provided for application to work. If you would like to include both [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) and [Service Discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html) targets, `CloudMapNamespaces` must be supplied (with or without `EcsClusters`). When **both parameters** are supplied, the end result is only an intersection of targets that exist in ECS clusters and CloudMap namespaces provided.

> **Permissions**: IAM permissions are required to discover ECS clusters (`ecs:Get*`, `ecs:List*`, `ecs:Describe*`) and CloudMap namespaces (`servicediscovery:Get*`, `servicediscovery:List*`, `servicediscovery:Discover*`, `route53:Get*`)

## Usage Example

For the full example of running this in AWS, please navigate to [/example](/example) folder.

You can also refer to [appsettings.json](src/Apptality.CloudMapEcsPrometheusDiscovery/appsettings.json) for supported configuration parameters.

Example run command:

```bash
  docker run --rm \
    # ** REQUIRED PARAMETERS **
    # At least one of "EcsClusters" or "CloudMapNamespaces" must be provided.
    -e DiscoveryOptions__EcsClusters="<cluster1>;<cluster2>" \
    -e DiscoveryOptions__CloudMapNamespaces="<namespace1>;" \
    # If running outside of AWS - pass credentials explicitly
    # If running in AWS - use Task IAM Role.
    # IMPORTANT: Credentials need to have permissions to describe ECS cluster(optionally CloudMap namespaces)
    -e AWS_REGION="us-west-2" \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<key>" \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<secret>" \
    -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<session_token>" \
    # ** OPTIONAL PARAMETERS **
    # Will only include those services, which have 'prometheus_target' tag set to 'true'.
    # Leave blank to include all services in cluster(s)
    -e DiscoveryOptions__EcsServiceSelectorTags="prometheus_target=true;" \
    # Same as above, but for filtering out CloudMap services
    # Leave blank ot include all services in namespace(s)
    -e DiscoveryOptions__CloudMapServiceSelectorTags="prometheus_target=true;" \
    # Semicolon separated string of tag names to include in the service discovery response as metadata.
    # Supports glob pattern matching using * and ?.
    -e DiscoveryOptions__EcsTaskTags="*" \
    -e DiscoveryOptions__EcsServiceTags="*" \
    -e DiscoveryOptions__CloudMapServiceTags="AmazonECS*;" \
    -e DiscoveryOptions__CloudMapNamespaceTags="*" \
    # Semicolon separated string of labels to include in the service discovery response as metadata.
    # Will be added to all discovered targets.
    -e DiscoveryOptions__ExtraPrometheusLabels="custom_static_tag=my-static-tag;" \
    # Tag prefix to identify metrics port, [path | "/metrics"], [name | ""] triplets.
    # Please refer to the configuration options to learn more.
    -e DiscoveryOptions__MetricsPathPortTagPrefix="METRICS_" \
    # Add new or modify existing labels in the response using token replacements,
    # to prevent the need of modifying your Grafana dashboards.
    # Please refer to the configuration options to learn more.
    -e DiscoveryOptions__RelabelConfigurations="cluster_and_service={{ecs_cluster}}-{{ecs_service}}" \
    # Instructs .NET application to listen on 9001 inside the container
    -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://*:9O01" \
    # ** DOCKER **
    -p 9001:9001 \
    apptality/aws-ecs-cloudmap-prometheus-discovery:<version>

Plays nice with and originally designed for [OpenTelemetry receivers config](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#receivers). See [example](/example) for more details.
